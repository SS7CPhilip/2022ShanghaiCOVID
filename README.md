# 2022ShanghaiCOVID

This script was created for Shanghai COVID-19 epidemic starting March 2022. It tracks address posted on Shanghai GOVERNMENT ONLINE (https://ss.shanghai.gov.cn/), geocode using Baidu API and save into csv. Following can be used by mapping module or import to GIS for spatial analysis. 

Due to the format isn't uniform day to day, this script may not work for every day. It will print the days which are not able to process. You may add more possible delimiters or use other ways to improve it.
